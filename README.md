##Mem Reduct

Small application that allows you to monitor and clean your computers memory. Exempt system cache, modified, and idle memory pages. As a result of the program, the memory usage is reduced by ~ 25%. For correct working, need administrator rights.

The program used undocumentedfeatures of system (Native API) to clear the memory that have emerged since Windows Vista, so some cleaning methods are not available in earlier versions Windows.

The lightweight application is less than half a megabyte, and it is compatible with Windows XP SP3 and higher operating systems. You can download either the installer or portable version.

To activate portable mode, create "memreduct.ini" in application folder, or move it from "%APPDATA%\Henry++\Mem Reduct".
